Overall, it is a basic but decent device from Samsung in this price range. It has a good processor, Helio G85, and you're getting One UI 6.1, which is definitely not full-fledged as on the flagships, but for this price tag, even this from Samsung is admirable.

Overall, it is a basic but decent device from Samsung in this price range. It has a good processor, Helio G85, and you're getting One UI 6.1, which is definitely not full-fledged as on the flagships, but for this price tag, even this from Samsung is admirable.
