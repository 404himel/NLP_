To iterate through all pages using only the "Next Page" button, you can use its XPath and the .click() function inside a loop. The idea is to:

    ~ Locate the "Next Page" button using its XPath.

    ~ Click the button to load the next set of data.

    ~ Wait for new content to appear.

    ~ Repeat until the "Next Page" button is no longer available or clickable.
